# AAB2APK: AAB -> APK the easy way

AAB2APK provides an easy way for you to convert your `.aab` file to an `.apk` one. The application allows you to drag and drop the file you want to convert, and points you to the converted file.

## Setup

1. From the [releases](https://github.com/makunomark/aab2apk/releases) page, find the latest release and download an install file.
1. On first run, the application will request you to download [bundletool-all-1.0.0.jar](https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases/download/1.0.0/bundletool-all-1.0.0.jar). If you already have one, drag and drop it to the space.
